        Group will meet during lab time. During lab, group will determine if another meeting for the week is needed and will schedule the next meeting. If 
        the group could not meet during lab they will schedule a different meeting. Meetings outside of lab should not exceed one hour; if additional 
        time is needed, group with schedule additional meetings. Group will track attendance to meetings in a document in Teams. 
        Consequences will occur after a third missed meeting. Being more than 5 minutes late to a meeting on 3 occassions will count as a missed meeting.

        Everyone should respond to email or Teams chats within 24 hours, except on weekends.
